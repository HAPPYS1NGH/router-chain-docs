description: How to build truly cross-chain dApps using Router?
---

This section will include a step-by-step guide to building truly cross-chain dApps by leveraging Router's infra. We'll showcase this guide with the help of some basic cross-chain applications like cross-chain Ping Pong (message transfer) and cross-chain ERC1155 (NFT transfer). This guide will make use of the cross-chain communication framework described earlier and will include code snippets and explanations for each step involved in the process.

Recognizing that different developers work on different tech stacks, we have included guides for all types of chains supported by Router.
