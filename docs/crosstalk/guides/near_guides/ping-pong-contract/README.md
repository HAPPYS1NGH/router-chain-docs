### Overview

In this section, we will create a cross-chain ping pong smart contract using the Router CrossTalk. We will be creating a system where we can send a message from the source chain to a destination chain and receive back the acknowledgement from the destination chain. So basically, we will send a ping to the destination chain and receive a pong back on the source chain.
