title: Step 3) Configure and Run an Orchestrator Instance
sidebar_position: 3
---
If you have followed the preceeding steps properly, you should already see an orchestrator config created at `~/.router-orchestrator/config.json`. Now, let's configure and run an orchestrator instance.

<!-- Before proceeding with this step, make sure that you are running a validator. If note, follow [this guide](./setup-a-validator-account) to become a validator. -->

<summary><b>Step 3.1) Create a new wallet for the orchestrator</b></summary>

```bash
routerd keys add my-orchestrator-key --chain-id router_9601-1 --keyring-backend file
```

The aforementioned command will create a new wallet with name `my-orchestrator-key` and will ask you to set a password. 

:::caution
Remember the password used or store it in a safe place. 
:::

```bash
# example output

- name: my-orchestrator-key
  type: local
  address: router13cffzsfgjklfq17poq2ifm0xn426ing3bqk5q1
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/routerprotocol.routerchain.crypto.ethsecp256k1.PubKey",
  mnemonic: ""
  
**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```
:::tip
The mnemonic phrase is better backed up on a physical paper, storing it in cloud storage may compromise the validator later.
:::

:::tip
Remember the address starting fromÂ `router`, this is the address of your Router chain orchestrator account.

<summary><b>Step 3.2) Obtain ROUTE token</b></summary>

Now, add funds to your orchestrator wallet as it will be used to pay for the gas fees:

```bash
routerd tx bank send <validator-node-key-name> $(routerd keys show my-orchestrator-key -a --keyring-backend file) 1000000000000000000route --from my-validator-key --chain-id router_9601-1 --fees 1000000000000000route --keyring-backend  file
```

After a few minutes, you can verify the deposit by querying the account balance using the following command:
```bash
routerd query bank balances $(routerd keys show my-orchestrator-key -a --keyring-backend file) --chain-id router_9601-1 --keyring-backend file
```

<details>
<summary><b>Step 3.3) Configure the orchestrator keys</b></summary>

Add the relevant keys in `.router-orchestrator/config.json`:

```json
{
    "chains": [
        {
            "chainId": "<CHAIN_ID>",
            "chainType": "<CHAIN_TYPE>",
            "chainName": "<CHAIN_NAME>",
            "chainRpc": "<CHAIN_RPC>",
            "blocksToSearch": 1000,
            "blockTime": "10s"
        }
    ],
    "globalConfig": {
        "networkType": "<NETWORK_TYPE>",
        "dbPath": "processedblock.db",
        "ethPrivateKey": "<ETH_PRIVATE_KEY>",
        "cosmosPrivateKey": "<COSMOS_PRIVATE_KEY>",
        "batchSize": 100,
        "batchWaitTime": 20
    }
}
```

- `chains` is an array of objects including info about all the chains you want to listen to as an orchestrator. For each chain, you need to provide:
    - `chainId` - the chain id of the network
    - `chainType` - the type of chain, possible values are:
        `CHAIN_TYPE_ROUTER`,
        `CHAIN_TYPE_EVM`,
        `CHAIN_TYPE_COSMOS`,
        `CHAIN_TYPE_POLKADOT`,
        `CHAIN_TYPE_SOLANO`,
        `CHAIN_TYPE_NEAR`
    - `chainName` - the name of the chain
    - `chainRpc` - the RPC endpoint of the chain


- `globalConfig` includes global configuration details like:
    - `NETWORK_TYPE` - the network type, possible values are:
        `devnet`,
        `testnet`
    - `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` - the private key of the wallet you created for the validator on EVM chains (not necessary to have have funds in this wallet, it will be used just for signing)
    - `COSMOS_PRIVATE_KEY` - the private key of the wallet you created for the validator

Sample `.router-orchestrator/config.json`:
```json
{
    "chains": [
        {
            "chainId": "80001",
            "chainType": " CHAIN_TYPE_EVM",
            "chainName": "Mumbai",
            "chainRpc": "<RPC_URL>",
            "blocksToSearch": 1000,
            "blockTime": "10s"
        },
        {
            "chainId": "43113",
            "chainType": " CHAIN_TYPE_EVM",
            "chainName": "Fuji",
            "chainRpc": "<RPC_URL>",
            "blocksToSearch": 1000,
            "blockTime": "10s"
        }
    ],
    "globalConfig": {
        "mQEndpoint": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost",
        "networkType": "testnet",
        "dbPath": "processedblock.db",
        "ethPrivateKey": "<PRIVATE_KEY>",
        "cosmosPrivateKey": "<PRIVATE_KEY>",
        "batchSize": 100,
        "batchWaitTime": 20
    }
}
```

<summary><b>Step 3.4) Map the orchestrator with your validator</b></summary>

Every orchestrator needs to be mapped with a validator. This is done by sending a transaction on the chain to map an orchestrator with a validator.

```bash
routerd tx attestation set-orchestrator-address $(routerd keys show my-orchestrator-key -a --keyring-backend file) <EVM-ADDRESS-FOR-SIGNING-TXNS> --from my-validator-key --chain-id router_9601-1 --fees 1000000000000000route
```

`EVM-KEY-FOR-SIGNING-TXNS` is the public address corresponding to the `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` used in the orchestrator config in the previous step.

<details>
<summary><b>Step 3.5) Start the orchestrator and validator</b></summary>

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart cosmovisor.service
sudo systemctl restart router-orchestrator.service
```

After executing the aforementioned commands, your orchestrator instance will start running. You can check the orchestrator and validator logs to see if everything is working fine.

```bash
sudo journalctl -u router-orchestrator.service -f
sudo journalctl -u cosmovisor.service -f
```
